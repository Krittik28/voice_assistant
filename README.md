# Speech Recognition and Response with OpenAI's GPT-3

This program uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate responses to user speech input. The user speaks to the program, and the program transcribes the audio to text using the Google Speech Recognition API. The text is then passed to GPT-3, which generates a response. The response is then read back to the user using the Pyttsx3 text-to-speech library.
# Requirements

    Python 3.6 or higher
    OpenAI API key
    Pyttsx3 library
    SpeechRecognition library

# Usage

    Set your OpenAI API key in the openai.api_key variable.
    Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
# speechrecognition.
    Run the program with python main.py.
    Say "hello" to start the program.
    Speak to the program and wait for a response.

# Functionality

    The program waits for the user to say "hello" before proceeding.
    After the user says "hello," the program prompts the user to speak and records the audio.
    The audio is transcribed to text using the Google Speech Recognition API.
    The text is passed to GPT-3, which generates a response.
    The response is read back to the user using the Pyttsx3 text-to-speech library.
